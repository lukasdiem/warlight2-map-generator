# Warlight 2 Map Generator

This repository contains code to create randomly generated maps for the Warlight 2 AI challenge 
([http://theaigames.com/competitions/warlight-ai-challenge-2](http://theaigames.com/competitions/warlight-ai-challenge-2)).
The generator creates *.json formatted files that represent the structure that can be fed into the Warlight 2 engine. 

Additionally, there is the possibility to render maps, either using matplotlib, or writing each region and skuperregion
into a separate image. These "layer" files can be used to visualize for example the game process, by re-coloring them
accordingly. Code to this can be found at [https://github.com/klejah/hwv.git](https://github.com/klejah/hwv.git).

# Demo Images

Just two demo images to show the output of the generator:
